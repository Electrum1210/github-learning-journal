# Week 2 Lesson 3 – Desktop history and risk

## What I did
- Used GitHub Desktop History to inspect recent commits in my fork.
- Linked commits to safe/medium/high risk categories.
- Updated the safe vs risky table in ROADMAP.md.

## What I learned (manager view)
- History in Desktop shows the same decision timeline as GitHub.com, but with diffs right next to messages.
- It’s easier to judge risk when I can see both the folders touched and the exact scope of the diff.
- Behaviour changes (functions/api, tools scripts) deserve more attention than small content tweaks.

## Questions for Aleks
- When a high-risk change is needed (functions/api or deploy script), what extra review steps should we require?
