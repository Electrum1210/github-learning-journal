# Week 4 Lesson 2 – Review guide

## What I did
- Created REVIEW-GUIDE.md as a reusable repo review checklist.
- Filled in an initial assessment section for thedaydreamverse-site.

## What I learned (manager view)
- A simple written guide makes repo reviews more consistent and faster.
- Most signals I care about (structure, history, PR habits, releases) are visible without reading code.

## Questions for Aleks
- Are there any project-specific checks we should add (e.g., SEO, accessibility, performance)
