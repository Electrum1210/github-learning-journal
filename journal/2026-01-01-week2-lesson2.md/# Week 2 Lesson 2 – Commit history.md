# Week 2 Lesson 2 – Commit history timeline

## What I did
- Reviewed 7 commits in DeDaydreamer/thedaydreamverse-site.
- Classified each by files changed and risk level (Low/Medium/High).
- Added a detailed commit risk table to ROADMAP.md.

## What I learned (manager view)
- Most changes are small content or styling updates (low risk).
- Changes touching config, tools, or api/behaviour are rarer and need higher scrutiny.
- Initial commits and build/deploy scripts represent broad or operational risk.

## Questions for Aleks
- What testing or review happens before changing tools/pull-vault.sh or functions/api?
- Are there any “must check” items for content changes that affect SEO/UX?
