# 2025-12-20 – Lesson 1 (Part 1)

## What I did

- Confirmed upstream vs fork using:
  - DeDaydreamer/thedaydreamverse-site (upstream)
  - Electrum1210/thedaydreamverse-site (my fork)
- Opened my fork in GitHub Desktop and local folder.
- Added a manager note in Markdown to my fork (README or MANAGER-NOTES.md).
- Committed and pushed the change using GitHub Desktop.

## What I learned (manager view)

- Upstream = original project owned by Aleks; my fork = my sandbox copy that can diverge and later sync back.
- A commit is a snapshot of decisions, not just code edits.
- Markdown is the standard way to document context and intent in GitHub READMEs and notes.

## Questions / things to ask Aleks

- Are there any existing docs in thedaydreamverse-site that describe deployment and environments?
- Is there a preferred place to put manager notes (README vs a dedicated docs folder)?

## Last completed

- Last completed: Week 1, Lesson 1 – First manager note in thedaydreamverse-site fork
