# Week 4 Lesson 4 – Summary dashboard

## What I did
- Added repo summary table to REVIEW-GUIDE.md showing both repos side-by-side.
- Created ALEKS-QUESTIONS.md consolidating all manager questions.

## What I learned (manager view)
- A one-page dashboard makes it easy to compare repo health and spot patterns across projects.
- Consolidated questions are ready to send to Aleks as a single, prioritised list.

## Next steps
- Share ALEKS-QUESTIONS.md with Aleks for answers.
- Apply review process to third repo (if another DeDynamics project exists).
