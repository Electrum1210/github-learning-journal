# Week 3 Lesson 1 – Fork vs upstream

## What I did
- Compared DeDaydreamer/thedaydreamverse-site (upstream) with my fork.
- Checked how many commits my fork is ahead of upstream and what they contain.

## What I learned (manager view)
- Fork divergence (ahead/behind) is a simple numerical signal of how different my copy is from the source-of-truth.
- Each ahead commit represents a decision that must eventually be reviewed and either merged, reworked, or dropped.

## Questions for Aleks
- In this project, how much divergence (number of commits) is acceptable before we worry?
- Should we enforce any rules for how long a fork can stay ahead without an open PR?
