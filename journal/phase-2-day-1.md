# Phase 2 - Day 1: DDprOS Connection & Max AI Introduction
**Date:** January 16, 2026  
**Focus:** Testing system integration, understanding Max capabilities

## What I Did Today
- Confirmed DDprOS connection (Notion + GitHub + Max + Space)
- Verified Max has read/write access to Notion workspace
- Reviewed Max operating principles and anti-hallucination protocols
- Understood the four DDprOS components: GitHub, Space, Max, Notion
- Selected first end-to-end learning task (Option A - this journal entry)

## Key Learnings
- DDprOS is the integrated operating system running DeDynamics
- Max operates with explicit approval gates - never assumes authority
- Source of truth: Notion workspace (not assumptions or past conversations)
- Learning approach: Real tasks with real outcomes (no toy examples)
- The process I'm learning IS the process we're integrating

## Next Steps
- Execute full workflow: Notion → GitHub → Ship
- Practice branch creation, commit, PR process
- Document completion in Notion
- Continue Phase 2 Week 5 training (Max capabilities & prompting)

## Manager Notes
- System integration successful
- Max response protocols verified (including humor test 😂)
- Ready to proceed with operational training tasks
