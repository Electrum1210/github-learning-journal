## Week 5: Foundations + Workflows (Jan 17-23)

### Day 1-2: Max Capabilities & Limitations

**Learning Goal:** Understand what Max can and cannot do

**Topics:**
- Max's access scope (Notion, GitHub, file uploads)
- What Max can't do (authorize spending, final strategic decisions)
- AI confidence vs hallucinations
- When to verify AI outputs
- How Max integrates with DeDynamics systems

**Practice Exercise:**
- Ask Max: "What can you help me with for DeDynamics operations?"
- Compare response to official capabilities list
- Identify 3 tasks Max can do vs 3 tasks requiring human escalation

**Output:** Create personal reference note in Notion with Max's boundaries

### Day 3-4: Effective Prompting Framework

**Learning Goal:** Structure requests for optimal AI responses

**Topics:**
- Prompt anatomy: Context + Intent + Constraints
- Good vs bad prompt examples
- Iterative refinement techniques
- ADHD-friendly templates (clear, actionable, 3-bullet format)
- Handling unclear AI responses

**Practice Exercise:**
- Rewrite 5 poorly-structured prompts using the framework
- Test each prompt with Max and compare results
- Build personal prompt template collection

**Output:** 5 working prompts saved in PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md

**Resources:**
- See [PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md](PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md) for examples

### Day 5-7: GitHub-Notion Sync Workflows

**Learning Goal:** Automate project tracking without manual work

**Topics:**
- Setting up automated progress tracking
- Triggering Max to sync GitHub commits to Notion
- Creating project status updates automatically
- Monitoring repo activity through Max
- Understanding sync triggers and cadences

**Practice Exercise:**
- Trigger: "Max, sync my github-learning-journal progress"
- Verify sync accuracy in Notion
- Request custom sync for DeDynamics project
- Set up weekly auto-sync reminder

**Real-world scenario:**
Use the exact workflow from your own COO Learning Progress page:
- GitHub commits → Max pulls latest activity → Notion page updates
- Weekly Monday trigger pattern

**Output:** 
- Working sync workflow documented in your learning journal
- 3 successful sync operations completed

## Week 6: Advanced Applications (Jan 24-30)

### Day 1-2: Technical Decision Support

**Learning Goal:** Use Max for code review and risk assessment (manager view)

**Topics:**
- Reviewing GitHub PRs with Max's assistance
- Risk assessment prompts for code changes
- Architecture clarification questions
- Translating technical → operational language
- Red flags to watch for in repos/commits

**Practice Exercise:**
- Pick a PR from thedaydreamverse-site fork
- Ask Max: "Review this PR from a manager perspective: [PR URL]"
- Use Max to identify: scope, risk level, communication quality
- Compare your assessment to Max's analysis

**Output:** 
- Manager review checklist with Max integration
- 2 PR reviews completed using Max

### Day 3-4: Documentation Automation

**Learning Goal:** Auto-generate and maintain project documentation

**Topics:**
- Creating README files from Notion data
- Generating checklists and templates

- Creating/updating Notion pages via Max
- Formatting Notion-flavored Markdown

**Practice Exercise:**
- Ask Max to create Notion page from project brief
- Generate README.md for practice repo

- Build reusable documentation template

**Output:**
- 2 Notion pages created/updated via Max
- 1 README generated for GitHub repo
- Template saved for future use

### Day 5-7: Operational Patterns + Final Project

**Learning Goal:** Build custom operational workflow using Max

**Topics:**
- Daily/weekly check-in automation
- Project status report generation
- Task delegation decision tree
- Creating repeatable workflows
- Measuring time saved

**Final Project:**
Build one custom operational workflow that:
- Solves a real DeDynamics operational need
- Uses Max for automation
- Can be repeated weekly/monthly
- Saves at least 30 minutes per execution

**Example workflows:**
- Weekly project status digest (pulls from Master Projects DB)
- GitHub activity summary across all DeDynamics repos
- Automated learning progress reports
- Department-level progress rollups

**Output:**
- 1 custom workflow fully documented
- Workflow tested and validated
- Time savings measured
- Shared with team for feedback

## Daily Check-in Structure

**Every day (5 minutes):**
1. Review lesson topic
2. Complete practice exercise
3. Document what you learned (2-3 sentences)
4. Note any blockers or questions
5. Trigger: "Max, update my learning progress"

**Weekly sync (30 minutes):**
- Review week's progress with Aleks
- Troubleshoot any stuck points
- Adjust pacing if needed
- Celebrate wins

## Troubleshooting

**If Max gives unclear responses:**
- Add more context to your prompt
- Break complex requests into smaller steps
- Ask Max to explain its reasoning
- Refer to PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md for structure

**If you're stuck:**
- Tag @DeDaydreamer in Notion
- Ask Max: "I'm stuck on [task]. What should I try?"
- Review Decision Tree for escalation criteria

**If falling behind:**
- Prioritize MVP exercises (marked with ⭐)
- Skip optional deep-dives
- Extend timeline by a few days (communicate with Aleks)
